/**
 * A ThreadFactory which creates non-daemon threads with a name indicating which pool they came
 * from.
 *
 * A new ThreadGroup is created with the passed-in name, as a sub-group of whichever thread
 * creates the factory. Each new thread will be a member of this group, and have a unique name
 * including the group name and an increasing number. The idea is to make it easy to identify
 * members of a thread group in debug output.
 *
 * For example, a NamedPoolThreadFactory with the name "writer" will create a ThreadGroup named
 * "writer" and new threads will be named "writer-1", "writer-2", etc.
